-- | In the class `IsParser` we assemble the basic properties we expect parsers to have. The class itself does not have any methods. 
--   Most properties  come directly from the standard 
--   "Control.Applicative" module. The class `ExtAlternative` contains some extra methods we expect our parsers to have.

class (Alternative p, Applicative p, ExtAlternative p) => IsParser p

class (Alternative p) => ExtAlternative p where
   -- | `<<|>` is the greedy version of `<|>`. If its left hand side parser can
   --   make any progress then it commits to that alternative. Can be used to make
   --   parsers faster, and even get a complete Parsec equivalent behaviour, with
   --   all its (dis)advantages. Intended use @p \<\<\|> q \<\<\|> r \<\|> x \<\|> y \<?> \"string\"@. Use with care!   
   (<<|>)  :: p a -> p a -> p a
   -- | The parsers build a list of symbols which are expected at a specific point. 
   --   This list is used to report errors.
   --   Quite often it is more informative to get e.g. the name of the non-terminal . 
   --   The `<?>` combinator replaces this list of symbols by the string argument.   
   (<?>)   :: p a -> String -> p a
   -- |  `must_be_non_empty` checks whether its second argument
   --    is a parser which can recognise the empty input. If so, an error message is
   --    given using the  String parameter. If not, then the third argument is
   --    returned. This is useful in testing for illogical combinations. For its use see
   --    the module "Text.ParserCombinators.UU.Derived".
   must_be_non_empty   :: String -> p a ->        c -> c
   --
   -- |  `must_be_non_empties` is similar to `must_be_non_empty`, but can be 
   --    used in situations where we recognise a sequence of elements separated by 
   --    other elements. This does not make sense if both parsers can recognise the 
   --    empty string. Your grammar is then highly ambiguous.
   must_be_non_empties :: String -> p a -> p b -> c -> c 
   -- | If 'p' can be recognized, the return value of 'p' is used. Otherwise,
   --   the value 'v' is used. Note that `opt` by default is greedy. If you do not want
   --   this use @...\<\|> pure v@  instead. Furthermore, 'p' should not
   --   recognise the empty string, since this would make the parser ambiguous!!

-- | The input state may maintain a location which can be used in generating error messages. 
--   Since we do not want to fix our input to be just a @String@ we provide an interface
--   which can be used to advance this location by passing  information about the part recognised. This function is typically
--   called in the `splitState` functions.

-- | The data type `T` contains three components, all being some form of primitive parser.

--   and whether you want to have the results in an online way (future parsers), or just prefer to be a bit faster (history parsers)

-- | The data type `Steps` is the core data type around which the parsers are constructed.
--   It describes a tree structure of streams containing (in an interleaved way) both the online result of the parsing process,
--   and progress information. Recognising an input token should correspond to a certain amount of @`Progress`@, 
--   which tells how much of the input state was consumed. 
--   The @`Progress`@ is used to implement the breadth-first search process, in which alternatives are
--   examined in a more-or-less synchronised way. The meaning of the various @`Step`@ constructors is as follows:
--
--   [`Step`] A token was succesfully recognised, and as a result the input was 'advanced' by the distance  @`Progress`@
--
--   [`Apply`] The type of value represented by the `Steps` changes by applying the function parameter.
--
--   [`Fail`] A correcting step has to be made to the input; the first parameter contains information about what was expected in the input, 
--   and the second parameter describes the various corrected alternatives, each with an associated `Cost`
--
--   [`Micro`] A small cost is inserted in the sequence, which is used to disambiguate. Use with care!
--
--   The last two alternatives play a role in recognising ambigous non-terminals. For a full description see the technical report referred to from 
--   "Text.ParserCombinators.UU.README".
